## Balanced Inventory
**Balanced Minecraft** is a vanilla+ project which aims to make lesser used mechanics in survival more competitive with more popular progression paths. It should make the survival experience overall more novel and challenging, while making progression more satisfying.

**Balanced Stack Sizes** allows configurable changes to the maximum stack size of items.

See the full list of features on the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/project/balanced-stack-sizes).
